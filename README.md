# Right-Angled-Triangle

Question: Right Angled Triangle

Write a program that reads a number N and prints a Right Angled Triangle of N rows using stars (*).

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input number N.

Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the current row.

Use a while loop to print the triangle, incrementing the counter variable in each iteration.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input number

First, we need to read the input number N which represents the number of rows in the triangle. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Initialize a counter variable

Next, we need to initialize a counter variable, which will help us keep track of the current row in the triangle. We will set the counter to 1 initially.

Step 3: Use a while loop to print the triangle

Now, we will use a while loop to print the triangle. The loop will run until the counter is less than or equal to the input number N. Inside the loop, we will print the stars (*) for each row and increment the counter variable by 1 in each iteration.
